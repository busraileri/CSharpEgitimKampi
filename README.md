## ðŸ“Ž Project 1: MainSubjects
The project involves printing text to the screen using the **`Console.WriteLine`** and **`Console.Write`** methods, defining and using **string variables** to create a reservation card
containing customer information, defining **integer variables** to determine and display prices for a restaurant menu, and defining the quantity of products along with 
calculating the total price. This project encompasses the fundamental structure of the C# language and **user interaction**.

## ðŸ“Ž Project 2: Variables
In this project, the prices and weights of apples, oranges, strawberries etc. are defined using the **double data type**, and the total prices of these products are 
calculated. Then, the **char data type** is used to define and print a character. To gather passenger information, string variables are used for keyboard input, and this information is 
displayed on the screen. Additionally, to obtain the quantity of products, int variables are utilized for keyboard input, and the total price is calculated. To acquire gender information,
the **char data type** is used for keyboard input, and this information is printed on the screen.

## ðŸ“Ž Project 3: MakingDecision
In this project, various scenarios are implemented using **if-else structures** and **switch-case statements**. Inputs such as password, capital city and country information, numbers, and exam grades 
are received from the user, and validation and evaluation are carried out based on these inputs. Additionally, the average of exam grades is calculated and evaluated based on specific ranges, 
and when the user enters a city, it is checked whether the city exists in the list. In the switch-case section, operations such as month names and calculator functions are performed based on the 
user's selection. And the details of selected categories from a restaurant menu are displayed, and modulo operations are used to check whether a number is even or odd.

## ðŸ“Ž Project 4: Loops
In this project, **for** and **while loops** were used to implement various scenarios and decision structures. Initially, in the for loop examples, loops were executed within a specified range, 
printing a message at each iteration. Then, in examples involving conditional structures, operations like printing numbers that meet certain criteria and calculating their sums were performed. 
Additionally, the doubling of bacteria every hour was printed.In the while loop section, as long as the condition was met, the loop continued, and specific operations such as summation examples 
were carried out. Finally, a program was written to calculate the sum of the digits of a three-digit number entered by the user.

## ðŸ“Ž Project 5: LoopsWithStars
In this project, various shapes have been created using the **asterisk symbol (*)**. First, asterisks were printed both vertically and horizontally, with 10 asterisks in each case. Then, a pattern with 
10 asterisks on each line was created. Afterward, right-angled triangles and inverted right-angled triangles were drawn using nested for loops. These triangles were combined to form a symmetrical shape.
A diamond shape was formed by handling the top and bottom sections separately. Additionally, pyramid and inverted pyramid shapes were constructed by aligning spaces and asterisks properly. 
These examples demonstrate how different loop structures and logic can be used to print various geometric shapes on the screen using asterisks.

## ðŸ“Ž Project 6: Arrays
In this project, fundamental **array operations and methods**. First, arrays of different types such as strings, integers, and characters are initialized and elements 
are accessed by their index. Arrays are also used to store and display data such as colors, cities, and numbers. The examples include listing all elements of an array using a for loop and applying 
conditions such as finding numbers divisible by **Array.Sort() and Array.Reverse()** are used to sort and reverse arrays, respectively. Additionally, other array methods such as **IndexOf()** 
are used to find the position of a specific element in an array, while functions like **Max() and Min()** retrieve the largest and smallest elements. 

## ðŸ“Ž Project 7: ForeachLoop
In this project, an example of a **foreach loop**. The foreach loop is used to iterate over elements in data structures such as **arrays and collections**. For instance, 
each element in an array of cities or numbers can be printed one by one. Additionally, specific operations can be performed on the numbers; only even numbers can be printed or the total 
sum of all numbers can be calculated. The quiz system application calculates the average grades of students. First, the user is prompted to enter the number of students in the class, and 
then three exam scores are entered for each student. The average of these scores is calculated to determine whether the student has passed or failed the course. 

## ðŸ“Ž Project 8: Methods
In this project, **void methods**, **methods that return values**, and **methods with parameters**. Void methods, such as CustomerList() and Sum(), perform tasks without returning a value, like printing customer names or calculating a sum. 
The snippet also shows void methods that accept string and integer parameters, such as WriteMethod() and Sum(int number1, int number2, int number3), which print customer information or the sum of three numbers.
Methods like CustomerName() and CountryCard() return values, providing customer names or formatted country information. The code includes an example application, ExamResult(), 
which calculates a student's average score based on three exam results and returns a message indicating whether the student passed or failed.

## ðŸ“Ž Project 9: DatabaseProject
In this project, a **database system for managing products and categories** is created using ADO.NET. The application begins by displaying a menu that allows users to choose between different tables: 
Categories, Products, Orders, or exit the application. The program connects to the MSSQL database named "EgitimKampiDb" using **SqlConnection**, opening a connection to retrieve data. A **SqlCommand** is 
executed to select all entries from the TblCategory table. The data is then transferred to a DataTable using a **SqlDataAdapter**, which serves as a bridge between C# code and the SQL database.
